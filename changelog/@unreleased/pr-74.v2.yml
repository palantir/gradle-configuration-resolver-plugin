    Extend DefaultTask instead of AbstractTask; use lazy task creation

    I noticed the former causing deprecation warnings indicating this
    won't be possible in Gradle 7.0.

    I also tried setting up cross-version testing in this repo that
    would catch said deprecation warning, but it ends up running into
    other deprecations around certain configurations being resolved
    (which I suspect will just be flipped over to having isCanBeResolved
    be false in 7.0, and thus will be ignored by this plugin at that
    time).

    Other modernizations I did sneak in: Lazy task registration and
    assuming that Configuration#isCanBeResolved exists (it was added
    in 3.3).
